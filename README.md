Supports Economic Growth – The software industry fuels job creation and innovation, making it a critical part of modern economies.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference highlighted the "software crisis," where projects suffered from delays, cost overruns, and poor quality. It marked the beginning of efforts to apply structured engineering principles to software development.
The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s)
In response to the software crisis, structured programming emerged as a methodology to improve code clarity, maintainability, and efficiency. Techniques like modular programming and the use of control structures (such as loops and conditionals) replaced unstructured "spaghetti code." Languages like C, Pascal, and Ada helped popularize this approach.
The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001)
Traditional software development models, such as the Waterfall model, struggled to accommodate rapid changes. The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, introduced principles emphasizing collaboration, iterative development, and flexibility. Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban, revolutionized software development by enabling faster delivery and continuous improvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Defines project goals, feasibility, scope, budget, and timeline to ensure a structured approach to development.
Requirement Analysis – Gathers and documents functional and non-functional requirements through stakeholder discussions to understand project needs.
Design – Creates software architecture, UI/UX design, and system specifications to outline how the software will function and interact.
Implementation (Coding) – Developers write code using programming languages and frameworks, following best practices for efficiency and maintainability.
Testing – Evaluates the software for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues through unit, integration, and system testing.
Deployment – Releases the software for users, either in phases or all at once, ensuring smooth installation and minimal disruptions.
Maintenance – Provides ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and enhancements to improve functionality and address user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where a project progresses through predefined phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, making it a highly structured method.
Key Characteristics of Waterfall:
Rigid structure: Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is completed.
Detailed planning: Heavy documentation is created upfront to guide the entire process.
Minimal customer involvement: Stakeholders provide input primarily at the beginning and review the final product at the end.
Late-stage testing: Bugs or issues are typically discovered in the testing phase, often near the end of development.
When to Use Waterfall:
Waterfall is ideal for projects where requirements are clear, stable, and unlikely to change. Examples include:
Construction projects: Building a skyscraper, bridge, or highway, where extensive planning and a sequential process are necessary.
Medical device software: Requires rigorous regulatory approval, making detailed documentation and structured testing essential.
Enterprise software rollouts: Large-scale systems (e.g., ERP implementations) that involve extensive upfront requirements gathering and integration.
Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative, flexible approach that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and incremental delivery. Instead of following a strict sequence, Agile breaks a project into small iterations, or sprints, allowing for continuous improvements based on user feedback.
Key Characteristics of Agile:
Flexibility: Changes can be made at any stage of development.
Frequent customer involvement: Stakeholders are actively engaged throughout, ensuring the product meets evolving needs.
Continuous testing: Testing is integrated into every sprint, allowing for early bug detection.
Incremental delivery: Features are developed and released in cycles rather than waiting for the full product to be completed.
When to Use Agile:
Agile is best suited for projects where requirements are uncertain, evolve over time, or rapid iterations are beneficial. Examples include:
Startups and tech companies: Developing a new mobile app where features are shaped by user feedback.
E-commerce platforms: Websites like Amazon that require constant updates, A/B testing, and new feature rollouts.
Video game development: Games that evolve based on player testing and iterative improvements.
